/*
    These functions find all the possibilities of n multiple choice questions.

     For the iterative version, we utilize the built-in Queue interface with
     a LinkedList implementation. On each iteration we check the size of the
     queue, and we remove each element and append a T and F to previous
     combinations, and then adding them as new Strings causing us to get to
     2^n possibilities which is the formula for finding all outcomes given
     n multiple choice questions.

     For the recursive version, we use a prefix String to keep track of each
     outcome. We make a binary tree figure as we recurse through each time
     because in the recursive function, we call that same function twice,
     causing the creation of a binary figure. In the end we would've called
     our function (2^n) * 2 times meaning we would get 2^n different outputs
     which would meet all of our possibilities.
